				Suppose that we already have the following theorem.<br>
				If $G$ is a connected planner simple graph with $e$ edges and $v$ vertices,
				where $v \geq 3$, then $e \leq 3v - 6$.<br>
				Using this theorem to prove that if $G$ is a connected planner simple graph
				with at least three vertices, then $G$ has a vertex of degree not exceeding five.
