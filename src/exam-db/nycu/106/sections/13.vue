			Political affiliations change from one generation to the next.
			We consider three parties, labeled D, K, and T.
			In one generation, membership in D goes 80% to D, 10% to K, and 10% to T;
			membership in K goes 20% to D, 80% to K, and none to T; 
			and membership in T goes 50% to D, 10% to K, and 40% to T.
			What is the longâ€‘term steady state for the three parties (membership ratios among these three parties)?
