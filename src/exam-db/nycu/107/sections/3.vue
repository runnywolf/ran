			Assume we have already defined a predicate $prime(x)$ which is true if and only if $x$ is a prime number.
			Otherwise, the predicate is false. Also assume that we are concerned with natural numbers only.
			Please translate the following statement into a formula in predicate logic:<br>
			<div class="ts-content ts-text is-center-aligned">
				“Every natural number that is greater than 6<br> can be written as the sum of three prime numbers.”
			</div>
