			Among the 900 three‑digit integers (from 100 to 999) those such as 131, 222, 303, 717, 848, and 969,
			where the integer is the same whether it is read from left to right or from right to left,
			are called palindromes. Without actually determining all of these three‑digit palindromes,
			we would like to determine their sum. Please calculate the sum of these palindrome ranging from 100 to 999.
