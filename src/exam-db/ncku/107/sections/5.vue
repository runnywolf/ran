			Suppose we randomly choose nonnegative integers $x_1,~ x_2,~ x_3,$ and $x_4$
			that solve the equation $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 10$.
			We assume that each solution has an equal probability of being chosen.
			Given that at least one of $x_1$ and $x_2$ is equal to $2$,
			what is the probability that $x_2 = 2$?
