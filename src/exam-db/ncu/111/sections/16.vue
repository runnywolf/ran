			$A$ and $B$ are two square matrices.
			(A) If $A$ is similar to $B$, then $\det(A) = \det(B)$.
			(B) If $A$ is similar to $B$, then $A$ and $B$ have the same eigenvectors.
			(C) If $A$ is similar to $B$, then $A^2$ is similar to $B^2$.
			(D) If $A$ is similar to $B$, then $AB$ is similar to $BA$.
			(E) If $A^2$ is similar to $B^2$, then $A$ is similar to $B$.
