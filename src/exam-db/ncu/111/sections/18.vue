			If $A$ is a $m \times n$ matrix and $A$ can be $QR$ factorized. $W$ is the set of all columns of $A$, and $W^\perp$ is the orthogonal complement of $W$, then.
			(A) $W$ is a subspace.
			(B) $W^\perp$ is a subspace.
			(C) $(W^\perp)^\perp = W$.
			(D) $W \cap W^\perp = \phi$ (empty set)
			(E) $m \geq n$.
