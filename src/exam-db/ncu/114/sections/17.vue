			Several handshakes take place under the following rules:
			no one shakes hands with themselves or their own partner,
			no one shakes hands with the same person more than once,
			and the number of handshakes for the other seven people (excluding you) are all different.
			Based on these conditions, how many hands did you shake, and how many hands did your partner shake?
