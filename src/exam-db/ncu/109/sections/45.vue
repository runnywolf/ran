			Two undirected graphs, $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$, are isomorphic if
			A. $|V_1| = |V_2|$.
			B. $|E_1| = |E_2|$.
			C. The number of vertices with any given degree is the same in both $G_1$ and $G_2$.
			D. For every subgraph of $G_1$, there is a subgraph of $G_2$ that is isomorphic to it.
			E. All of the above must hold.
