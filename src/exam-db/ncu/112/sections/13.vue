			Which of the following about eigenvalues/eigenvectors are true?
			A) If an 8x8 square matrix has 8 positive pivots after applying Gaussian elimination, then its eigenvalues cannot be negative.
			B) For the two square matrices $A$ and $B$, both of which are diagonalizable, if $AB = BA$, then $A$ and $B$ have the same eigenvalues.
			C) If two square matrices $A$ and $B$ are similar, i.e., $A = MBM^{-1}$, then $A$ and $B$ have the same eigenvalues.
			D) For a square matrix $A$, the matrices $AA^T$ and $A^TA$ have the same eigenvalues.
			E) None of the above is true.
