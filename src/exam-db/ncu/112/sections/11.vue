			Which of the following statements about symmetric matrices are true?
			A) The symmetric matrix $A$ has a complete set of orthonormal eigenvectors even though it has repeated eigenvalues.
			B) For the symmetric matrices $A$ and $B$, $A + B$ and $AB$ are both symmetric.
			C) If the rank of a symmetric matrix, $A_{n \times n}$, is $r < n$, then its $n-r$ eigenvalues are zero.
			D) The eigenvalues of symmetric matrices are real values. In other words, they cannot be complex values.
			E) None of the above is true.
